Hello people, Thank You for being here. We really appreciate you for joining us to clean our mother earth. The main aim of this project is to keep our environment clean by bringing more awareness among the people about the disposal of waste. Clean-up drives are conducted for cleaning the environment and for bringing more awareness. So we came up with a great idea for making clean-up drives more productive and to engage people at large scale.

This is a web application for clean-up drives which enables event creation and registrations in a very easy way. Are you interested in sponsoring, conducting or volunteering for an event. Then contact us right now. If you code and wish to contribute. Then, you are in the right place, this is a free and open source software, go through the documentation to know more about the key features of the application and start your contributions today.

This web application is built to provide easy management and registration of events for the authorities conducting the event and the students who are taking part in the event. This application is mainly focused on the events with green initiatives like clean up drives. Basically, events are scheduled and shown on the website and interested students can register.

There are different roles in the web application namely Event Managers, Volunteers, Participants and Administrator. Users are supposed to sign up for the first time. Admin will give access to users as event managers or volunteers after contacting him according to the requirement. They can create events and add teams and assign volunteers to each and every team. Students can directly register for the event and join a particular team. Then volunteers of the particular event can manage their team like check in and check out the participants during the event. Event Managers can manage the event and see the statistics of the registrations of a particular event. 

It is easy to manage data and event managers will get a clear picture on the registration status and it has many more benefits like events are scheduled neatly, registration status is shown to the students and they can revert their seat anytime until registrations closes. Teams can be formed as needed and essentially the history of all the events, registrations and participants are recorded securely and can be used for any purposes later on.
